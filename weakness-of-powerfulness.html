      Day 1 
<P>
On a cold, dark day, a small girl named Sarah was running through her family’s mansion, laughing as her older brother, Charlie, chased her. Their laughter filled the halls, and soon, another brother, Henry, who was younger than Charlie but older than Sarah, joined them. After playing for a while, Charlie said, "I have to attend a meeting," and left them. Henry and Sarah continued to play together.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was being held on the ground floor, in a grand hall furnished with a long table. At the head of the table sat Richard Habsburg, their father, who was a powerful mafia boss controlling operations across various continents, including Europe, Asia, Africa, and North America. Seated around the table were several other mafia bosses, all of whom were under Richard's command. The meeting was in progress when Henry and Sarah, still playing, wandered toward the hall. Sarah ran into the meeting room, with Henry close behind her. He stopped at the door and asked for permission to enter, which was granted. Sarah, however, had already made her way to her father’s side.
</P>
<P>
Henry tried to pull Sarah back, but she began to cry and pleaded with her father, "I want to play with you." Charlie tried to comfort her, but she refused to be consoled. Richard, deeply fond of his daughter, stood up, and as he did, everyone else in the hall rose with him. He announced that the meeting would be postponed until the next day, much to everyone's surprise. But none of the attendees questioned him; one by one, they left the room in silence.
</P>
<P>
Richard then began playing with Sarah, and as evening fell, the family sat down for dinner. The meal was mostly quiet, with only Richard and his brothers engaging in conversation. Afterward, they retired for the night.Sarah often slept with her father, Richard, and sometimes with Henry, her other brother. That night, she chose to sleep beside her father, while Henry returned to his room. Once there, he started playing video games for a while, snacking on some fruit before finally going to bed. The room darkened, and Henry's thoughts began to drift.
</P>
<P>
Henry was a quiet, disciplined young man. Though he had access to wealth, luxury, and power, he preferred to live simply. He had a passion for driving supercars and motorcycles, but he often chose not to flaunt his status. Once, he even went to the market alone, without any security, disguising himself by covering his face. While there, a group of thugs attempted to kidnap and assault him, not realizing who he was.
</P>
<P>
With no other choice, Henry had pulled out his handgun and shot two of them in self-defense. When the police arrived at the scene, they were prepared to arrest him, but Henry called his personal assistant, who was also his best friend. Upon learning Henry's identity, the police quickly backed down, too afraid to take him in. They eventually declared the incident a "fight gone wrong," letting Henry walk away without consequence. Henry didn’t seek attention or to boast about his power, but he made sure everyone knew exactly who he was if they crossed him.
<P></P>
Day 2 
<P>
The morning was crisp, and the soft light barely filtered through the curtains of Henry’s room. Sarah, his little sister, slipped inside quietly, gently shaking him awake. Henry stirred, blinking groggily at her, then smiled and pulled her into a warm embrace. "Morning, princess," he whispered, lifting her slightly before placing her back down. Together, they walked hand-in-hand to the dining room, where they ate breakfast in comfortable silence. Sarah’s bright chatter filled the air while Henry remained his usual quiet self, though his gaze lingered protectively over her.
After breakfast, Henry had something on his mind. He needed to speak with Charlie. He walked to his older brother's room and knocked on the door.
</p>
<P>
“It’s me, Henry,” he said.
</p> 
<P>
“Come in,” Charlie replied, his voice deep and commanding as always. Henry entered and found Charlie seated at his desk, reviewing some important family documents.
</p> 
<P>
“Charlie, I was wondering… can I go to school today without security? It’s my first day, and I just want to experience it on my own.”
<P>
Charlie looked up sharply, his eyes narrowing. “No, Henry. Absolutely not. You’re my star. I can’t risk anything happening to you. You’re too important.”
</p> 
<P>
Henry sighed but knew better than to argue with Charlie. When his brother made a decision, there was no changing it. He left Charlie’s room feeling a little defeated but unwilling to give up completely. Back in his own room, he packed his school bag, carefully selecting his outfit for the day. He liked to keep things simple but refined—black Prada shoes, custom-made loose-fit Gurkha pants, a black shirt, and a sweater. He slipped his AirPods in and took a deep breath. Even if he couldn’t go completely unguarded, he wanted a sense of freedom.
</p> 
<P>
Determined, Henry sought out Amin, one of the family’s most trusted bodyguards. He repeated the request he had made to Charlie, hoping for a more lenient answer.
Amin paused, considering Henry’s words. “Alright,” he finally said. “But I’m not letting you go alone. Take two guards with you. They’ll keep their distance, but thethey’ll be watching. Agreed?”  
</p> 
<P>
Relieved, Henry nodded. It wasn’t exactly what he wanted, but it was better than nothing. He made his way to the family’s expansive garage—a gleaming showroom of automotive perfection. Supercars, antique models, and even a Formula 1 cars stood in line, each one meticulously maintained. Today, Henry chose the BMW M5. It was fast and stylish but understated enough for him to blend in.
</P>
<P>
He drove to school, parking the car a little further away from the entrance to avoid drawing too much attention. Once inside, he felt the weight of anonymity settle over him—a relief. No one here knew who he was, except for the principal, and that was exactly how Henry preferred it.
</P>
<P>
After putting his bag in a locker, Henry noticed a boy standing nearby. Something about him struck Henry as familiar—not in appearance but in his quiet, brooding demeanor. The boy looked like someone who preferred to keep his distance from others, much like Henry did.
</P>
<P>
Curious, Henry walked over and asked, “Do you know where the chemistry class is?”
</P>
<P>
The boy glanced at him briefly before responding. “I’m heading there. Follow me.” They walked side by side down the hallway, not saying much, but Henry could sense an unspoken understanding between them. They both sat on the same bench during class, and Henry found comfort in the fact that no one—neither students nor teachers—paid him any extra attention.
</P>
<P>
 As the day drew to a close, something else caught Henry’s attention. A girl he had seen in a few of his classes stood out to him. She was different from the others—innocent, silent, and naturally beautiful. She wasn’t loud or attention-seeking. She wore sneakers, loose-fit jeans, a hoodie, and a pair of headphones rested around her neck, as though she always kept herself separate from the world. Her quiet presence intrigued him, though he didn’t dwell on it. Henry was not the type to become distracted by such things.
</P>
<P>
That’s when Zayn, the boy he had spoken to earlier, approached him again.
</P>
<P>
“Hey, can you lend me some money? I need it to get home,” Zayn asked, his tone casual.
</P>
<P>
Henry hesitated for a moment. He wasn’t usually one to hand out favors like this, especially not to someone he barely knew. But after a second’s thought, he reached into his pocket and handed over some money without saying much.
</P>
<P>
Zayn grinned, nodding in thanks. “Wait here,” he said, before disappearing for a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
When Zayn returned, it wasn’t on foot. Instead, he pulled up in a sleek, roaring Lamborghini. The bright car gleamed under the sunlight as Zayn rolled down the window, a satisfied grin on his face.
</P>
<P>
“I test everyone,” Zayn said, leaning slightly out of the window. “No one ever passes, but you did. Can I be your friend?”
</P>
<P>
Henry, as usual, didn’t let the display of wealth or the sudden gesture phase him. His face remained calm, his tone unchanged as he simply replied, “Okay.”
It wasn’t much of a reaction, but Zayn didn’t seem to mind. Henry wasn’t someone who was easily impressed, but something about Zayn’s straightforwardness earned his respect. It was the start of an unusual friendship, built on few words but plenty of understanding. 
</P>
<P>
Henry and Zayn exchanged a few words, their conversation casual but pleasant. Zayn, the son of a multi-millionaire, admired the simplicity of Henry’s life, often expressing his desire to live in a similar way, away from the pressures of wealth and status. Despite Zayn’s curiosity, Henry remained guarded, sharing nothing about his personal life. After a brief chat, Zayn headed home, still intrigued by Henry’s mysterious and quiet demeanor.
</P>
<P>
Henry saw the girl again later that day, and something about her seemed off. She looked sad, her usual calm demeanor clouded by some invisible weight. Without thinking much, Henry approached her.
</P>
<P>
“I can drop you where you need to go,” he offered, his voice steady and calm. But the girl said nothing. She didn’t even acknowledge his presence, just walked away silently.
</P>
<P>
Henry frowned. He hated it when people acted out of ego, and her silence felt like that. Without pushing further, he turned and left, getting back into his car. While driving down a narrow street, his gaze drifted, and to his surprise, he saw the girl again. This time, she wasn’t alone. A group of guys was following her, watching her every move with a predatory gaze. It was clear they had been stalking her for some time.
</P>
<P>
Henry felt a surge of protectiveness and made a quick decision. He pulled up beside her and called out, “Sorry, I’m late! Get in the car,” he said, trying to sound familiar, like they knew each other. The girl paused for a moment but refused, her voice firm, “I’ll go by myself.”
</P>
<P>
Henry wasn’t deterred. “Look, I’m really sorry,” he continued, trying to keep the act going. But again, she refused, turning away from him and continuing to walk.
</P>
<P>
The group of guys, noticing the exchange, approached Henry. They pushed him, smirking with a dangerous glint in their eyes. “We know she’s not your girlfriend,” one of them sneered. “You’re just pretending. We know everything about her.”
</P>
<P>
Henry sighed, annoyed by their arrogance. Without saying a word, he lifted his hoodie slightly, revealing a handgun tucked securely at his waist. The moment the guys saw the gun, their bravado disappeared. “Sorry, man!” one of them stammered, fear flashing in his eyes. They quickly turned and ran off, their tough-guy act crumbling in seconds.
</P>
<P>
The girl, sensing something had happened behind her, turned around just in time to see the guys running away. Her eyes flicked back to Henry, and for the first time that day, there was a change in her expression. She looked relieved, maybe even a little happy. Those guys had been stalking her for weeks, and now they were gone.
</P>
<P>
As she turned and continued walking, she glanced back one last time, offering Henry a small, grateful smile before disappearing into the distance. Henry, watching her leave, felt the tiniest hint of satisfaction. He hadn’t done it for recognition, but her smile was enough. Without another word, he got back into his car and drove away, the silent connection between them lingering in the air.
</P>
<P>
As Henry walked toward his car, he saw two police officers waiting by it. His car had been parked in a no-parking zone. One of the officers asked, "Is this your car?" Henry nodded. The officers looked at him and said, "You’re a minor. Do you even have a driver’s license?" Henry calmly replied, "I’m just one year away from getting it." The officers exchanged excited looks. "This is perfect. We’re going to get a promotion," one of them said. Turning back to Henry, they added, “You’re driving without a license, so you’re under arrest.”
</P>
<P>
Henry remained calm and said, "I think your families are waiting for you at home." The officers didn’t back down, smirking as one of them replied, “You and your father are going away for a long time. And don’t think your threats scare us.”
</P>
<P>
(if by any chance his brother Charlie or their father Richard Habsburg found out about this, the consequences would be severe. Richard could have these officers killed and their police station leveled without breaking a sweat.)
</P>
<P>
Henry, trying to stay composed, said, “Do you know who I am? I don’t want your families to get dragged into this because of your foolishness. My mood’s good right now—don’t ruin it.”
</P>
<P>
One of the officers laughed mockingly. “Who the hell do you think you are? You’re just a spoiled kid. Your father might be a pitbull, but you’re just a dog. You can’t do anything."
</P>
<P>
Henry’s expression didn’t change. "I’m Henry Richard Habsburg. Does that name mean anything to you?" At the mention of his family name, one officer’s face turned pale, and the other began to tremble. One even visibly peed his pants out of fear. They immediately started apologizing, their arrogance completely gone.
</P>
<P>
At that moment, Henry’s bodyguards arrived. Without hesitation, Henry removed one of his shoes and struck the officer who had insulted his father, hard. The officer cried out, "Please, sir, hit us more if you want, but don’t hurt our families!" Both were now in tears, completely terrified by what they had gotten themselves into.
</P>
<P>
Henry, satisfied, got into his car and drove home. He knew what would come next for those officers. His family wouldn’t let such disrespect slide, and the consequences for them were inevitable.
</P>
<P>
Henry walked into his house when Sarah came running toward him, wrapping her arms around him in a tight hug. "I missed you!" she said excitedly.  
</P>
<P>
Henry smiled and replied in a soft voice, "I missed you too. Let me freshen up first, and then you can tell me all about your day."  
</P>
<P>
He headed to his room, dropped his bag on the bed, and was about to change when his phone rang. It was Zayn.  
</P>
<P>
"Yo, I’m waiting at a café. Come over," Zayn said.  
</P>
<P>
"Alright, I’m coming," Henry replied.  
</P>
<P>
Before leaving, he turned to his little sister. "We’ll talk in the evening, okay? I have to go now."  
</P>
<P>
He then went to his garage, hopped into his sleek black BMW M8, and drove to the café.  
</P>
<P>
As they sipped their coffee, Henry leaned in slightly and said, "Hey, you know that girl? The quiet one—cute, innocent. She’s in our grade."  
</P>
<P>
"Who?" Zayn asked, raising an eyebrow.  
</P>
<P>
"The one who sits at the front in chemistry class. She was answering all the questions today," Henry explained.  
</P>
<P>
Zayn’s expression changed. His voice turned quiet and a little sad. "Yeah… I know her. Her name is..."  
</P>
<P>

        True power, he learned, is not the absence of weakness — but the courage to hold it close and grow.
